Here's week six. Enjoy!

Damn week 6 was a game changer.

It's kind of insane how things work out sometimes.

The biggest news this week is that the Dean ended up signing my petition and I started working with Steer!

This externship is an amazing opportunity for me to build myself as a full-stack developer from the bottom up.

Other than that, this week focused a working in a group to build a game. I think this was the smoothest week so far in this bootcamp.

## Teamwork makes the game work

I loved working in a group. I loved how each of us were able to discuss our ideas with no judgement and work on whatever we were good at. Peter, took the role of the game's assets artist. I took the role of building some of the large features in the game. And Pablo, he took the role of combining the features I build with the main players. 

I had 3 days with this group before I started my externship. It gave me the chance to prioritize the most important parts of the game and help the group get them done. I wish I was able to see things through with the group till the end, but at the same time, an opportunity I was crashing out over all of last week came through and I was so excited to start it. 

I learned a lot this week, and felt no sense of inferiority complex. For the first time, I finally got to experience a week that was smooth sailing. 

Game dev was surprisingly fun for me! I was not expecting that - everyone always mentions how tough it is. Although I’m sure at a grander scale, with more layered game logic, it truly is tough. But for the purposes of this week, I found it logical, straightforward, and nothing extremely hard or unsolvable. And most importantly, it was creative and fun! There were so many ideas we had that we wanted to integrate if we had more time. 

My group worked with Godot - none of us had experience with it. We built a game inspired by the famous Soham Parekh - guy has fans, haters, secret admirers, those that relate or just all of the above. 

Introducing Over-Employed. Inspired by Soham, and Over-Cooked - a game that presents the player with an over-worked, aka over-employed, employee managing 10 different, overlapping tasks in the span of a 2-3 minute game. 

On Monday we were kind of intimidated, but we implemented our learnings from Fractal and broke it down in manageable pieces. We set 1-2 hour check-ins and kept each other accountable. At the end of the week, it was fun seeing everyone's games and how they built their games and their different formats. I found that extremely rewarding! I learned a lot looking at how everyone implemented certain features in their game. 

## Externship

Let's dive into the two days of my externship this week.

Majority of my time this week was just spent getting up to speed with the codebase and researching certain API integrations. I'm happy that the dev on my team is very understanding to the learning process I'm going through. He gave me a few bugs to fix over the weekend and I think that's the best way to get accustomed to the codebase. 

I got to see first hand how much detail there is behind building a product. The amount of work done, and re-done, and re-done again is insane. 

I never truly understood the scope of a singular codebase behind even a small scale startup, I can’t even imagine how huge it is for a larger company - no wonder onboarding takes so long.
