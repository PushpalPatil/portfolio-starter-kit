Here's week seven. Enjoy!

## Break

It's supposed to be break right now -- the point in the bootcamp I was looking forward to in the first month. I would finally be able to unwind, relax, take a breather after some intense weeks at fractal. 

But it's not and to be honest, I'm not complaining.

I'm grateful for the opportunity to be working with Steer. My externship is 3 weeks long and I can see myself grow. 

There are many ways this week was frustrating for me. Getting used to a new and larger codebase was the first and foremost the most overwhelming part of this process. But what I realized is that what was even hard is keep track of all the industry standard nuances : always run `npm build run` before pushing, each feature is on a new branch off of the main branch, always fetch efore creating a new branch etc etc. So many rules that I knew, but when you're trying to build fast, you just forget sometimes. 

## F*ck CORS

First two days of the week, I was shipping out features left and right. Felt unstoppable. But, every up has a down. I came across an impossible error. A CORS error. 

Oh my god this error threw me for a loop. I spent 2 days on this. Majority of the first day was trying to fix the feature I was working on to be perfect in all ways. The dev on the team also attempted it and got it working on his computer, I tried his code and I was facing the same issue on my laptop which definitely threw us both for a loop. 

In the end, we just ended up re-cloning the repos on my end. and it worked! I guess when in extreme doubt, delete everything? lol 

What was tough is that I was truly doubting myself as an engineer in this rough time. I started off the bootcamp with quite low confidence in myself and my ability to create things. It left a bitter-sweet taste because of these hiccups butttt 

never back down never WHAT!! ~ never give uppp

Overall, I feel like I'm learning a lot in terms of what it's like following industry standard in the new age of AI and how to efficiently work with a larger codebase. The influencer affiliate marketing world is new and exciting. 

I'm looking forward to a better next week.
