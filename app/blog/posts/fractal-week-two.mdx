Here's week two. Enjoy!

## Boohoo sick me 

I guess week 2 is almost over. that' s insane. 2/12 done. only 10 more left. 

I wonder which version of me is on at the end of this rainbow. which version am I going to shake hands with. 

This week was tough -  I was slightly sick in the beginning of this week, energy levels low. It may sound like an excuse, but it is the truth. Usually during school you just kind of deal with it - mostly because you don't care about being you 100% everyday. But here, I knew I had to prioritize rest. It was the only way to bouncing back to normalcy. 

There was one day this week when I only had 1 PR and no wins. Andrew reached out to me then and reminded me to "take it easy. don't panic. take deep breathes" 

I felt much relieved knowing that there was no sudden disappoinment that awaited me at the end of a failed day. 

However, the difference between Day 2 this week and Day 5 is worth noting. Today, I was able to finish and fully understand the BetterAuth tutorial -  something I've been struggling on for 2 days now. I can happily report back that I spent time understanding the miniscuel concepts with integrity and I feel better moving forward. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm still behind. But just knowing that not only did I complete a task, but that I know what I did inside and out is a great feeling. 

It makes me feel much better about completing the tasks I'm behind on. 

Anyways I'm not sure why this whole blog is just about my work this week. Finding a way to articulate things when you're brain is fried is tough. 

Reporting back soon for an updated version.
