Tbh I've been avoiding writing this blog for a while now. where do i start.  what do I say. so much that I might as well say so little.  so here I am on squibler.io forcing myself. 

what about: I'm tired as fuck leave me the fuck alone. but no. I cant fucking say that can I. 

This blog - can it be a diary? Should it be? nvm let's be professional shall we. 

So you're asking me how I feel right now? - t i r e d. how about that. and I don't mean just your regular old "oh I need a coffee ill be fine" tired. I mean the I think my mitochondria and my soul needs rest type of tired.  

no but truly. how I feel rn is : exhausted, slightly sick, about to crash out, behind of everyone... but boy oh boy do alive - more structured, disciplined, awake, focused, looking forward to the next best thing. It's been so long since I have worked this hard - last time was last spring during my masters? Although none of that hard work stuck to me. AI has really fucked up the ability to grasp concepts in 3D. 
 
So what I'm trying to say is - why was this week hard? let's dive deep. 

It was hard because what do you mean I have to think for myself and know the ins and outs of my whole application myself? Arn't we past this cmon.. lol no we're not

Prior to this bootcamp, I was in a pretty dark place where I didn't know what to do with my life to get where I wanted to 

did I know where I wanted to go? yes....? 
did I know how to get there ......maybe? ..... no. 

I was trying to do 10 things at once just attempting to find my footing in this world - 

what do I know best, what am i good at, what does the industry need, how can i conform myself to be what they need, but wait, I should be myself no?  I should just be an expert at what I like? especially if I know I have skill but how do I show them on paper? I'm a creative in a technical field - how do I tap into that? but if I'm just focused on that, arn't I too narrow sighted? shouldn't I be the jack of all trades - especially in tech? no but how do I do that. is that even in my scope. who do i ask for direction and help. ok no everyone SHUSH - school is my first priority, I'm doing a masters. ... but is it really? isn't getting my foot in the industry my first priority? ok so how do I do that ... annddd I've come full circle. 

I was this ^ but on repeat for 3 years. 

when your whole life has been people thinking for you, then AI thinking for you, you never really know how to practice trusting your own thought process. you never trust yourself to make it in the world. 

here comes Fractal. an once in a lifetime opportunity - a safe space for me to be as messy as i want, in fact push myself to not be perfect, practice failing and i will be rewarded for it. 

this is quite a hard concept for me to work around. fear of failure is deeply rooted in my instincts. 

At the beginning of this week, any slight error, any red on the screen and boom - anxiety sky rocketted, avoidance tendencies to the max, failure beliefs confirmed. Let's go back to what was working. But what was working wasn't the best. 

So how do I get to a better iteration, a better product? turns out, going through the errors, untangling the tangled, was the only way. 

This past week has been rewarding in multiple ways. 

I was able to make sense about a lot of concepts I didn't think I would be able to understand for a while - what yeeaarrrs of college didn't do, 1 week at fractal did.

now you might be thinking - pushpal what the f**k. 

Hear me out, your environment plays a huge factor in how you grow. for me, it was simple, sure I was attending classes, but eh they're hard, nothing makes sense - some things do, most don't, and AI is my buddy. my classes gave me a higher level view of what's happening, but I was not passionate enough about school to dive deep on my own time and most teachers will not explain how the concepts in their class connect with concepts outside of their class. so sure I took a cybersecurity and networking class - but wtf does that look like IRL and connected to concepts outside of class? 

Being in an environment filled with curious minds, and hard working people has given me the oppportuntiy to be the person I've always wanted to be - a detail oriented, creative and hard working individual.  I forgot what it was like to feel like myself. It's hard to find an environment that truly cultivates you as an individual, when you find it, you take it and you don't let it go. 



## Conclusion

While the spaces vs. tabs debate might not have a one-size-fits-all answer, it underscores the importance of consistency, readability, and team collaboration in software development. Whether a team chooses spaces, tabs, or a hybrid approach, the key is to make a conscious choice that serves the project's needs and to adhere to it throughout the codebase. As with many aspects of coding, communication and agreement among team members are paramount to navigating this classic programming debate.
